## Game Rules
* Randomly create a number of heaps where the number must either be 3, 5 or 7
* For each heap created, randomly assign the initial number of objects within the heap. The number can be either 9, 11 or 13
* Randomly assign the first player, either the human or the computer.
* The first player removes any positive and non-zero number of objects (including all objects) for any one heap
* The second player then does the same
* Play continues, alternating turns, until no objects remain in any heap.
* The player taking the last object(s) is the winner
